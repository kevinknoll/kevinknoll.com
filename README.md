Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)

## Prerequisites
See [Hugo Quick Install](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#quick-install) documentation

> Download the appropriate version for your platform from Hugo Releases. Once downloaded, the binary can be run from anywhere. You don’t need to install it into a global location. This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you don’t have a privileged account.
>
> Ideally, you should install it somewhere in your `PATH` for easy use. `/usr/local/bin` is the most probable location.

## How to Build
See [Hugo Basic Usage](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/#the-hugo-command) documentation

> The most common usage is probably to run `hugo` with your current directory being the input directory.
>
> This generates your website to the `public/` directory by default, although you can customize the output directory in your site configuration by changing the `publishDir` field.
>
> The site Hugo renders into `public/` is ready to be deployed to your web server
