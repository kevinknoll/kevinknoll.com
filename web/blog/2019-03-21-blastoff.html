<h1>Three, Two, One&hellip; Blastoff!</h1>
<p>After months (okay, years) of half-finished and archived drafts, the redesign of my personal website has finally launched! For the first time ever, it now has a blog and will serve as my notepad for all things web.</p>

<p>A lot has happened over the past decade plus and after a not-so-brief hiatus, I&rsquo;m back!. This site has gone through multiple iterations from portfolio and resume to a plain vanity landing page and back. Today it gets repurposed, refreshed, and relaunched.</p>

<h2>Paying it forward</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot both professionally and personally and it&rsquo;s only fair that I pay it forward. I hope you enjoy your stay and find something useful here.</p>
